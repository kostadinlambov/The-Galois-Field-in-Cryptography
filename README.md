# The-Galois-Field-in-Cryptography

Research about the uses of the Galois field. What are its properties? How can it be used in cryptography? Write a simple cryptosystem based on the field. Research production-grade systems based on the Galois field.

You can use the following questions to facilitate your research:
* What is a field?
* What is GF(2)? Why is it an algebraic field?
* How and why do we extend the field to have more elements, like GF(3), GF(4), etc.? Do they have any practical applications?
* What is perfect secrecy? How does it relate to the participants in the conversation, and to the outside eavesdropper?
* What is symmetrical encryption?
* How to encrypt one-bit messages?
* How to extend the one-bit encryption system to many buts?
* Why is the system decryptable? How do the participants decrypt the encrypted messages?
* Why isn't the eavesdropper able to decrypt?
* What is a one-time pad?
    * How does the one-time pad achieve perfect secrecy?
* What happens if we try to use a one-time pad many times?
    * Provide an example where you break the "many-time pad" security
* What are some current enterprise-grade applications of encryption over GF(2)?
* Implement a cryptosystem based on GF(2). Show correctness on various test cases
